The main objectives of this project are:
1.To implement K-Means clustering algorithm for customer segmentation
2.To implement DBSCAN algorithm for density-based customer grouping
3.To compare the performance of both algorithms using silhouette score
4.To visualize customer segments and identify their characteristics
5.To provide actionable insights for business decision-making
